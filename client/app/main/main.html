        <p class="large info-text">We set out to create an app tailored for college students. College campuses have communities unlike anything else. Students look out for each other. We wanted to create a tool that'd help manifest the trust college students place in one another.
         Use our app to find anything you lost on a college campus. If you lose something, enter a quick description of what it was you lost and a few locations as to where you think it'd be. Then, we'll search our database for items that have been found in those spots, and use the college's RA system as a drop off point for your lost item. The finder recieves small monetary compensation for each item that's successfully returned to its owner.</p>
